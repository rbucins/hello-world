# hello-world

My name is Red, this is my first semester at California State University Los Angeles.
I'm majoring in Economics because I enjoy investing in stocks, crypto, and the Forex market.
I also enjoy participating in sports, cooking, and playing music. I play the piano, the guitar, and sing.
I currently work with LAUSD and enjoy my job.

Thank you for reading!
